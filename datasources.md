Useful sources of regular data releases include:

* [Gov.uk's Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics) shows all the most recently published datasets - and also upcoming ones, so you can plan ahead. You can filter by type, topic or department.

* [Data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) is the open data portal for the UK government. Look for similar websites for other countries, and for city regions like [Birmingham](https://data.birmingham.gov.uk/) and [London](https://data.london.gov.uk/)

* [Expenses for Lords can be found here](http://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/whos-in-the-house-of-lords/house-of-lords-expenses/) - [here's a front page story that was made from this data](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/new-expenses-scandal-115-lords-11209593)
* Freedom of Information request responses often contain some data. Gov.uk [publishes some of those too](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications?keywords=&publication_filter_option=foi-releases&topics%5B%5D=all&departments%5B%5D=all&official_document_status=all&world_locations%5B%5D=all&from_date=&to_date=), and you can also search [WhatDoTheyKnow](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/), or look for 'disclosure logs' on public bodies in your field of interest. Here, for example is the [West Midlands Police FOI Disclosure Log](https://foi.west-midlands.police.uk/)
* Full Fact's [Finder](https://fullfact.org/finder/) includes links to dozens of other sources of data on various topics. Pick one that interests you.
