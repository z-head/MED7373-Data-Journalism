# Directed study: functions and computational thinking

This week you've been learning about **functions**, and how data journalists use computational thinking to break down problems, abstract them, identify patterns and solve them through a series of steps (algorithms). Now to put that into practice...

## Identify a story/dataset that presents a small challenge

One of the best ways to learn data journalism is to identify stories that need data journalism skills, but which aren't overly ambitious. Each project should stretch you a little further, and develop new skills.

Start, then, by identifying a dataset that you want to 'interview' for a story - or a story idea where you can find a relevant dataset. (Another example would be to identify some data you want to scrape, a visualisation challenge, or interactive tool - but those are for other classes).

## Break the challenge down into problems

Chances are that your story challenge is made up of more than one problem. Here are some examples:

In the BBC data unit's [baby names story](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/baby-names-2017), Dan Wainwright needed to:

1. Work out which name was the most popular for girls - and then do the same for boys
2. Work out which name was most popular in each region
3. Work out the names that had changed the most since 1996
4. Identify the popularity of recent celebrity names (film and TV characters, royals)
5. Calculate the number of names per 1,000 babies in each year since 1996

In [Birmingham Eastside's stop and search story](https://github.com/Birmingham-Eastside/stop-and-search), Olivia Lawlor needed to:

1. Work out the percentage of stop and searches made of each ethnic group for June 2016 - and June 2017
2. Calculate the difference between the two percentages
3. Calculate the total number of searches in each period
4. Calculate the difference between the total number of searches in each period
5. Calculate the percentage of searches which resulted in 'nothing found'
6. Calculate the percentage of searches which resulted in 'nothing found', by ethnic group
7. Map the locations where the higher number of stop and searches occur

## Identify what you need to do - find functions (or buttons/calculations) that can do it

You may not be able to solve every problem above, so start with the simple ones and/or your lead story angle. Examples might include:

* Sort by baby name rank
* Subtract rank in 1996 from rank in 2016 to get a 'change in rank' number
* Match names in one dataset (baby names) against names in another (celebrities)

## Write up the process as a tutorial for others

Use your own blog to write up the process for others to follow. An important skill in data journalism is being able to participate in *communities of practice*, and publishing blog posts like this is one way to do that. Remember there will always be people who know more than you - but also there will always be people who haven't solved the problem you've just solved!
