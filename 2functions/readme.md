# Spreadsheet functions: computational thinking

This repo contains resources for exploring functions and developing computational thinking (breaking problems down; abstraction; pattern recognition and algorithms). That includes:

* [Examples of computational thinking in journalism](compthinkingexamples.md)
* [Computational thinking challenge: calculating ages](compthinkingage.md)
* [Computational thinking challenge: cleaning dates](compthinkingdates.md)
* [Computational thinking challenge: extracting postcode districts](compthinkingpostcodes.md)
* [Directed study: computational thinking](compthinkingds.md)
