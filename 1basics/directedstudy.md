# Directed study: finding simple data stories

This week's directed study is to use the basic techniques of data journalism - filtering, sorting, percentages and pivot tables - to find basic stories in public data.

## Useful public data sources

I've collected a [list of useful data sources here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/datasources.md).

## Decide what might be interesting/newsworthy in that data

It's easy to start playing with the data and get distracted. Instead, first spend some time thinking about what might be interesting and newsworthy in that data. In particular, make sure you check what data has been collected, and what period of time it covers.

Here are some suggestions:

* **Change** - are things going up or down? ["Are prisons becoming more dangerous places?"](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/prison-assaults) is a story that tells us, yes, assaults are on the rise.
* **Lack of change** - if nothing is changing, sometimes that is newsworthy too. For example ["Give MPs deadline on hiring relatives, campaigners urge"](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/mps-registers-of-interest) highlights how many MPs are still employing relatives despite it being banned for new MPs.
* **Top or bottom** - which area is worst for something? Try to add context so it's not just 'the biggest place has the most events', e.g. ["Suicide risk greatest for low skilled male workers"](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/suicide-risk)
* **Surprise** - something which is higher or lower than you might expect, or something we had no idea existed, e.g. ["'Legal high' law secured 26 convictions in six months"](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/legal-high-convictions) or ["Illuminating facts about the UK's art collection"](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/art-uk)
* **Paint a 'big picture'** - tell the reader everything they need to know about their area or industry or subject of interest, e.g. ["Festivals dominated by male acts, study shows, as Glastonbury begins"](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/music-festivals)
* **Human interest** - health data is good for this (for example, numbers of twins), e.g. ["Midwife units see one in four mums transferred by ambulance to hospital"](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/midwife-led-units)

There are other types of story worth mentioning which you may not be able to do with those basic techniques. These include:

* **Patterns** - it might be rich vs poor, north vs south, or east vs west, or some other pattern that the data reveals. The story ["Teacher vacancy rate double in poor areas"](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/teacher-vacancies-deprivation) for example is about a pattern in vacancies which mirrors a pattern in deprivation (that doesn't mean cause and effect, however)
* **Curiosity/'What if?'** - The story ["How non-voters can change the outcome of an election"](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/non-voters) is an example of data journalism driven by simply asking the question "What if everyone who didn't vote instead voted for a 'none of the above' party?"


## Analyse your data to see if that story 'stands up'

Once you've decided on the story to investigate, dig into the data. At this stage try to pick something that's achievable, like: 

* Sorting data to find who's top/bottom
* Calculating a percentage to provide a snapshot (for example what proportion of money was spent on something)
* Calculating a percentage to show how much something has changed
* Using a pivot table to create aggregate totals or counts (that you can then sort, or use to calculate proportions)
* Filtering where you need to focus on a particular area or category

## Write it up in a few sentences

Now write up what you have. Don't write too much - 2 paragraphs is fine.

1. Paragraph 1: what the data reveals. Tell us the fact first, and the source second (", according to...")
2. Paragraph 2: any context, such as previous reports on this subject

If you want to flesh this out you can chase a quote or two too, but all you need for now is something to discuss in the next session.

## Reflect

**Important**: look at what you've done and think about any potential problems/pitfalls in that approach. Consider the whole process from selection to hypothesis forming, analysis and presentation. Could things be done differently? How might that change the results?
