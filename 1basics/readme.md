# Fork this repo!

GitHub is widely used in data journalism for a number of reasons:

* As a way to show how you arrived at your findings (transparency, accountability)
* As a way to make it easy for others to collaborate with you (for example, they might create new visualisations or tools with the data, find new leads, or highlight problems)
* As a way to find useful tools and techniques

This tutorial explains how to fork this repository so you will always have an up to date copy.

## First, some basics

I've [created a separate repository (folder) which explains how to get started with GitHub here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/introtogithub). 

Go there first to get to know GitHub.

## Fork this repo

Now, fork this repository by clicking on the 'Fork' button. 

A copy of this repo will be created within your own GitHub account. Underneath the name you should see a link back to the original.

## Create a pull request

1. On your repo webapge, go to the *Pull Requests* tab and click **New pull request**. 
2. You will be taken to the *Comparing changes* page. If you have made no changes to the repo, none will be shown, and it will say *Try switching the base for your comparison.* Click on this to switch the two bases. If that option is not available, change the 'base fork' dropdown to the name of your own fork (it will start with your username), then click *compare across forks* above to show the forks again, and finally change the 'head fork' to the original repo that you want to update from. 
3. You should now have your own fork selected in 'base fork', and the repo that you want to update from in 'head fork'. Any changes ('commits') will be shown in a list underneath. Click **Create pull request**.
4. The page will change to *Open a pull request*. You need to give this pull request a title: type 'Updating my fork from original' or something similar. This is just to help you or someone else understand the history of changes made to your repo. You can also add a description if you want.
5. Click **Create pull request** underneath the box
6. Now it should confirm that there are no conflicts with the 'base branch' (yours). Click **Merge pull request**, and **Confirm**

Your fork should now be up to date with any changes made since you forked it (or last updated it).
